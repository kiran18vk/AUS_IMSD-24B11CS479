    <p>Kohli's form in the lead-up to the World Cup was not at his best, however after a strong start to the 2015 World Cup with a century against Pakistan,[58] Kohli's tournament ended with a score of 1 in the semi-final loss to Australia.[59] A subsequent dip in form was followed by his first Test series win as captain in Sri Lanka.[60] From 2016 to 2018, he entered a peak phase of his career.[61] In 2016, he was the Player of the Tournament at the ICC World T20.[62] He became the first batsman to score double centuries in four consecutive Test series and was appointed captain for the 2017 Champions Trophy, where India finished as runners-up.[</p>
